In order to find out which neighbourhoods fit the corporate culture of this start-up, the founders need Foursquare location data. The data will be accessed via Foursquare API. As mentioned above, the founders will use Prague's numerical division of districts for their decision on where to locate their new office. Therefore, data about Postal codes of these districts will be needed. These data will be accessed thanks to a csv file from Prague's info websites. Together, our dataset will thus contain information about different venues in each Prague's district. With this data, we should be able to cluster each neighbourhood as the founders request and find the perfect matches for them.
